						<h3>Photogrammetry</h3>
						<p style ="padding-right: 10px;">While pursuing a Masters of Science, specializing in computer vision and 3D aerial surveying I have developed a passion for photogrammetry, particularily aerial photogrammetry. Flight plan creation is where the majority of my time has been invested in for my research. I have a deep undestanding of the core components needed to lay the foundation for producing quality models and products.</p>

					<h2>Flight Plan Automation</h2>
					<p>Many software packages capable of creating flightplans suitable for quadcoptors with VTOL capabilites neglect the advantages of the UAV itself. Survey software creates single layer flight plans based on desired side and forward overlap. Flight planning missions used in videography are much more free form but do not have the ability to standardize operation parameters eneded for photogrammetric work. The package created has the ability to take in single survey grade flight plan and automatically modfify it as specified. Re-create the maltese cross with a drone without the need of additional cameras. Fly missions in portrait to achieve a better Z accuracy. Create a standardized camera calibration flight plan of an environment incldung multiple flying heights, obliques and both portrait and landscape shots; all within a single flightplan mission. </p>

					<h2>Image Stitching</h2>
					<p>Image stitching is the process of combining multiple, overlapping images into a single composite image. All images must be aligned using and blended to reduce the number of artifacts that will negaticly impact the final result. TThis workflow has increased complexities when using aerial imagery. When creating a panoram on a phone or camera fixed on a tripod their the postion or pose of the camera remains constant. With aerial photography both of those elements are unique at each image and must be accounted for to create a stable result. Images taken aerially will also not just be in a single strip and can have their postion change about both the X and Y asix. The developed program, has the ability to stitch aerial photography into a singple image provided the images are inputted sequentually. </p>

					<h2>Algae Detection</h2>
					<p>Cyanobacteria algae blooms have the ability to engulf the majority of a lakes surface within hours, preventing sun from reaching the vegitation below. These algae blooms have the potential to kill entire ecosystems as as such are being monitored to better understaand what causes them and how to prevent them. The program developed produces a mask of the orgional composite sitched image of a body of water, identifying and highligting areas containing blooms. The image can the be used to collect statistical data for temporal and spatial tracking. Along with the detection program, a data training program was created to allow the user to maanually identify pixels containing algae to be used for accuracy assessment.</p>

					<h2>Independent Research Paper</h2>
					<p>Over the past decade, the capabilities of low cost commercial drones have advanced and are now being explored as viable UASs for research and industry work. These low cost flight systems have the capacity to produce imagery suitable for photogrammetric processing such as 3D outdoor modeling, DEM/DTM generation, and orthophoto generation. DJI drones have begun to dominate the commercial drone market. However, if these drones are to be used for more technical and industrial applications there are several drawbacks that must be addressed. Current flight planning software is not yet suitable for creating flight plans that follow the best practices of the aerial surveying industry. There is no simple solution for re-orienting the camera in the portrait orientation that also adjusts the image overlap accordingly. Additionally, there is no efficient way to leverage the multi access gimbal to allow for capturing oblique imagery. Lastly, the ability to hover at a single spot and take multiple images is currently a missed opportunity that is not often taken advantage of due to complexity. This workflow proposed will demonstrate a solution allowing for flight plans to be created while maintain the camera in a portrait orientation. This work will further demonstrate a method for capturing oblique aerial imagery using a method called the Maltese cross.</p>

					<h2>Journal Article | Presented at ISPRS Geospatial Week 2019</h2>
					<p>High-end consumer quadcopter UAVs or so-called “prosumer devices”, have made inroads into the mapping industry over the past few years, arguably displacing more expensive purpose-built systems. In particular, the DJI Phantom series quadcopters, marketed primarily for videography, have shown considerable promise due to their relatively high-quality cameras. Camera pre-calibration has long been a part of the aerial photogrammetric workflow with calibration certificates being provided by operators for every project flown. Most UAV data, however, is processed today in Structure-from-Motion software where the calibration is generated “on-the-fly” from the same image-set being used for mapping. Often the scenes being mapped and their flight-plans are inappropriate for calibration as they do not have enough variation in altitude to produce a good focal-length solution, and do not have cross-strips to improve the estimation of the principal point. What we propose is a new type of flight-plan that can be run on highly textured scenes of varying height prior to mapping missions that will significantly improve the estimation of the interior orientation parameters and, as a consequence, improve the overall accuracy of projects undertaken with these sorts of UAV systems.</p>
